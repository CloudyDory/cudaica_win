1. Place the folder in EEGLAB's plugins folder.
2, If you are using EEGLAB 14.1.2b, copy the two .m files to corresponding EEGLAB folder, overwriting the existing one (backup the original one first!).
   The two files does not actually calculate ICA but are needed to call CUDAICA from GUI and command line. Other EEGLAB versions are not tested. You can also study them and modify by your self :).
